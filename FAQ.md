# FAQ

Or rather, stuff I would ask, if I hadn't written it myself :)

## Where is what ?

* `.bootstrap` is the bootstrap configuration of the repository
* `.bootstrap.auto` is generated by mulle-bootstrap fetch, it contains
information recursively collected from dependent repostiories, that have their
own .bootstrap folder.
* `.bootstrap.local` contains local settings you can use to override settings
in .bootstrap and .bootstrap.auto. You create it manually.
* `~/.mulle-bootstrap` contains some global customizations. This becomes
autogenerated when using brew stuff.
* `build/.repos` contains intermediate files generated by the build, which can
be safely thrown away
* `dependencies` contains the produced headers, libraries and frameworks
* `/usr/local/libexec/mulle-bootstrap` contains scripts for mulle-bootstrap


### The default target/scheme is not the one I want ?

Put the target name into `.bootstrap/{reponame}/target`

```console
echo "Finch Demo" > .bootstrap/Finch/target
```

### Can it build to various specific SDKs ?

Put the SDK names into ".bootstrap/sdks".

```console
cat <<EOF > .bootstrap/sdks
iphoneos
iphonesimulator
EOF
```

Or if you don't want to change .bootstrap for temporary edits:

```console
cat <<EOF > .bootstrap.local/sdks
iphoneos
iphonesimulator
EOF
```


### I don't like the name "dependencies" for the output folder ?

You could rename it to "output" persistently with

```console
echo "output" > ~/.mulle-bootstrap/output_foldername
```

If want to rename for just this project ?

```console
mkdir -p .bootstrap.local 2> /dev/null
echo "output" > .bootstrap.local/output_foldername
```

If you do this after running **mulle-bootstrap setup-xcode**, you will run into
problems.

### Can I change the build folder from build/.repos to something else  ?

Better not. You can set it with "build_foldername".
But beware:

><font color=red>mulle-bootstrap assumes that it can just **rm -rf** the folder,
so choosing `~` or `/tmp` as a build folder is not a great idea.</font>

```console
echo "you_have/been_warned" > ~/.bootstrap.local/build_foldername
```

### Can I change the repository folder name from .repos to something else ?

Somewhat, but it must remain toplevel for now, otherwise the
detection of local clone copies gets wonky. So with that in mind: as above, but
use "repos_foldername" instead.

### What happens when I symlink something ?

It is assumed, that the repository link is "usable" as is. Specifically it won't
be recursively bootstrapped. It also won't get any kind of .bootstrap
inheritance. `mulle-bootstrap` will just **cd** there, give it the target
dependency folder, ### I specified SKIP_INSTALL=YES in my Xcode project, but
stuff gets installed nonetheless ?

Because this SKIP_INSTALL=YES is the default unfortunately and lots of project
maintainers forget to turn it off, **mulle-bootstrap** sets this flag to NO at
compile time. If you know that SKIP_INSTALL is correctly set, set
"proper_skip_install" to "YES".

```console
echo "YES" > .bootstrap/{reponame}/proper_skip_install
```

### How can I tweak some Xcode project settings ?

Lots of ways, probably the quickest is:

```console
mkdir -p .bootstrap/Foo 2> /dev/null
echo "BrandedFoo" > .bootstrap/Foo/PRODUCT_NAME
```


If you have lots of stuff, you may want to use your own **.xcconfig** file. This
is likely to be more useful if placed into the .bootstrap folder directly.

```console
cp myconfig.xcconfig > .bootstrap/xcconfig
```


Need to add some other magic Xcode build flags ?

```console
echo "-verbose" > .bootstrap/xcodebuild-flags
```

### Should I put build settings into .bootstrap/{reponame} or into .bootstrap ?

It's better to specify build settings on a per repository basis. Repository
settings can be inherited over recursive fetches. Build settings in `.bootstrap`
do not.

### My Xcode project's headers do not show up ?

Check that your Xcode project has a **Header Phase** and that the header files
are in "public".
