# FAQ

Or rather, stuff I would ask, if I hadn't written it myself :)

## Where is what ?

* `.bootstrap` is the bootstrap configuration of the repository.
* `.bootstrap.auto` is generated by mulle-bootstrap fetch, it contains
information recursively collected from dependent repostiories, that have their
own .bootstrap folder.
* `.bootstrap.local` contains local settings you can use to override settings
in .bootstrap and .bootstrap.auto. You may create it manually, but you don't
have to.
* `~/.mulle-bootstrap` contains some global customizations. This becomes
autogenerated when using brew stuff.
* `build/.repos` contains intermediate files generated by the build, which can
be safely thrown away at any time.
* `dependencies` contains the produced headers, libraries and frameworks
* `/usr/local/libexec/mulle-bootstrap` contains scripts for mulle-bootstrap



## Where is what in .bootstrap ?

* Files in `.bootstrap` itself are used for fetching dependencies and some
configurations.
* Files in `.bootstrap/config` are rarely used options, to change
mulle-bootstrap behavior.
* Files in `.bootstrap/settings` are used for building dependencies. Here you
find compiler flags, targets, sdks et.c.



## Where is what in .bootstrap.auto ?

* Files in `.bootstrap.auto` are an amalgamation of .bootstrap and the contents of
.bootstrap of the dependencies.
* .bootstrap/config should not exist
* Folders in `.bootstrap.auto/repos` are the settings inherited from
.bootstrap`.



### How are multiple value settings separated ?

Separation is done by newline, not by space.

```console
mkdir -p  ".bootstrap/settings" 2> /dev/null
echo "Debug Release" > .bootstrap/settings/configurations # WRONG
echo "Debug
Release" > .bootstrap/settings/configurations # RIGHT
```


### Can I change the build folder from build/.repos to something else  ?

Better not. You can set it with "build_foldername".
But beware:

><font color=red>mulle-bootstrap assumes that it can just **rm -rf** the folder,
so choosing `~` or `/tmp` as a build folder is not a great idea.</font>

```console
echo "you_have/been_warned" > ~/.bootstrap.local/build_foldername
```


### I specified SKIP_INSTALL=YES in my Xcode project, but
stuff gets installed nonetheless ?

Because this SKIP_INSTALL=YES is the default unfortunately and lots of project
maintainers forget to turn it off, **mulle-bootstrap** sets this flag to NO at
compile time. If you know that SKIP_INSTALL is correctly set, set
"xcode_proper_skip_install" to "YES".

```console
mkdir -p  ".bootstrap/settings/{reponame}" 2> /dev/null
echo "YES" > .bootstrap/settings/{reponame}/proper_skip_install
```


### I changed something in .bootstrap but nothing happens ?

This shouldn't really happen. Say `mulle-bootstrap clean dist` and try again.


### My Xcode project's headers do not show up ?

Check that your Xcode project has a **Header Phase** and that the header files
are in "public".



### I have a depencency on another library in the same project. The headers of
the dependency library are in `dependencies/usr/local/include`. What now ?

**mulle-bootstrap*+ can't manage xcodebuild dependencies, so you have to help
it. Specify the targets you want to build or set the proper dependencies in the
xcode project.



### I build an aggregate target and the headers end up in the wrong place

mulle_bootstrap has problems with aggregate targets. Built the subtargets
individually by enumerating them in ".bootstrap/settings/{reponame}/targets"


```console
mkdir -p  ".bootstrap/settings/MulleScion" 2> /dev/null
echo "MulleScion (iOS Library)
MulleScion (iOS Framework)" > .bootstrap/settings/MulleScion/targets"
```


### mulle-bootstrap does not do what I want  ?

Check out the SETTINGS.md file for help about tweaking mulle-bootstrap.

As an example, here is how to specify what target to build.

Put the target name into `.bootstrap/settings/{reponame}/targets`

```console
mkdir -p  ".bootstrap/settings/Finch" 2> /dev/null
echo "Finch Demo" > .bootstrap/Finch/targets
```

Use `mulle-bootstrap -V` to get an extensive trace.


### I want to only build with cmake

Any setting can be overriden by the environment:

```
MULLE_BOOTSTRAP_BUILD_PREFERENCES=cmake mulle-bootstrap build
```

### Is the order of the repositories important ?

Sometimes yes. Try to keep them in order of interdependency.

f.e. mulle-aba is dependent on mulle-allocator and mulle-thread,
but mulle-allocator is also dependent on mulle-thread, then put
mulle-thread ahead of mulle-allocator in the `repositories` file.


### Is it a problem if a repository appears twice ?

Sometimes yes. The dependency manager of mulle-bootstrap is not very
sophisticated. If you have dependencies like A -> B -> C and  A -> C, it's
better for mulle-bootstrap if you just specify A->B and B->C. If you also
declare A->C, you may run into problems.


### It's not working as I expect now what ?

Try to use some of the debug facilities. Each of these environment variables need to be
set to **YES** to work.

Environment Variable                  | Description
--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------
MULLE_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE               | turn on a little more output. If you set it to VERBOSE instead of YES, it produces quite a bit more output. Set it to FULL for exhausting detail.  Set it to 1848 for shell tracing.
MULLE_BOOTSTRAP_TRACE                 | traces shell commands as they are executed
MULLE_BOOTSTRAP_TRACE_SETTINGS        | traces settings accesses

It's easiest to use the three verbosity options though:

```console
mulle-bootstrap -v
mulle-bootstrap -V
mulle-bootstrap -t
```
