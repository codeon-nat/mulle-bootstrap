# "A B C" Tutorial

This directory contains a simple test with 3 folder A B C, each containing a
minimal Objective-C project.  C depends on B, which depends on A.
A depends on a system library "Foundation", which is a given.

A.h

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface A : NSObject

@end
```

B imports A, but expects the header to reside in a subdirectory A

B.h

```objectivec
#import <A/A.h>

@interface B : A

@end
```

C is quite like B.

C.h

```objectivec
#import <B/B.h>

@interface C : B

@end
```

Initially none of the folders contain a `.bootstrap` folder.

## Using xcodebuild


### First problem: the header isn't found

Try to build B with `xcodebuild`. It will not work, because the header
`<A/A.h>` will not be found.

The first step is to initalize B for **mulle-bootstrap**. You use inside the B
folder

```console
$ mulle-bootstrap init#
```

At that point a `.bootstrap` will be created with some default
content. Take the option to edit **repositories** and you should be in an editor
seeing:

```shell
# add projects that should be cloned with git in order
# of their inter-dependencies
#
# some possible types of repository specifications:
# http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/repositories/MulleScion
# git@github.com:mulle-nat/MulleScion.git
# ../MulleScion
# /Volumes/Source/srcM/MulleScion
#
```
Lines starting with a '#' are comments, these are just useless fluff in the
long run, so delete them all, and add a line containing 'A'.
The file now looks like this.

```
$ cat .bootstrap/repositories
A
```

Alright, ready to bootstrap.  First lets see what **mulle-bootstrap** will do
using the `-n`option

```console
$ mulle-bootstrap -n
Dry run is active.
mkdir -p .repos
There is a ../A folder in the parent
directory of this project.
Use it ? (y/N)
```

**A** will be found in the parent directory, and you have the option to use it,
which you should do.

```console
y
../A is not a git repository (yet ?)
So symlinking is the only way to go.
ln -s -f ../../A .repos/A
[ -e .repos/A ]

Dry run is active.
No repos fetched, nothing to do.
```

It can not preview the build stage, because there are no repositories really
setup yet.

The conservative choice now is to do it in two steps. **mulle-bootstrap fetch**
and then **mulle-bootstrap build**. **mulle-bootstrap** alone combined both
steps into one.

Lets go with **mulle-bootstrap fetch** first, so we can examine the build
processs afterwards. It will be just like above, but the symlink should be in
place now.

```console
$ mulle-bootstrap -n build
Dry run is active.

Collecting and dispensing "A" "Release" products
```

As the saying goes "Probieren geht Ã¼ber Studieren", so lets do it for real,
and use **mulle-bootstrap** build (or just **mulle-bootstrap**). This creates
a lot of output now shown here.

In the end we wind up with the "dependencies" folder, which should contain
the following files (`ls -GFR dependencies`):

~~~
include@
dependencies/lib/Debug/libA.a
dependencies/lib/Release/libA.a
dependencies/usr/local/include/A.h
~~~

**include@** is a symlink to `/usr/local/include`, that will always be there.
There is a library **libA** for each configuraration. The include file is in
`dependencies/usr/local/include`, which is not where we need it.

#### Tweaking the output

We can instruct **mulle-bootstrap** to place the headers somewhere else. This
is done on a per-repository basis in `.bootstrap/settings`. Since it's an
xcode project, it's more foolproof to use "xcode_public_headers":

```console
$ mkdir -p .bootstrap/settings/A
$ echo "/usr/local/include/A" > .bootstrap/settings/A/xcode_public_headers
```

Now build it again with **mulle-bootstrap**, the header should appear as
`dependencies/usr/local/include/A/A.h`, if not you may have made an exciting
mistake (see "Figuring out what went wrong").

Ok, the proof is in the pudding. Let's build B again with **xcodebuild**.
This will fail, because it doesn't know yet, to look in "dependecies/include"
at all.

#### Finally we have to tell xcodebuild where the dependencies are

```console
$ mulle-bootstrap xcode add
Settings will be added to B.xcodeproj.
In the long term it may be more useful to copy/paste the following
lines into a local .xcconfig file, that is inherited by all configurations.
-----------------------------------------------------------
// Common.xcconfig:
DEPENDENCIES_DIR=$(PROJECT_DIR)/dependencies
HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS=$(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/include /usr/local/include $(inherited)
LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS=$(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/lib/$(LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/lib/$(LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/lib/Release$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/lib/Release $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/lib /usr/local/lib $(inherited)
FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS=$(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/Frameworks/$(LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/Frameworks/$(LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/Frameworks/Release$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME) $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/Frameworks/Release $(DEPENDENCIES_DIR)/Frameworks $(inherited)


// Debug.xcconfig:
#include "Common.xcconfig"
LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION=Debug


// Release.xcconfig:
#include "Common.xcconfig"
LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION=Release
-----------------------------------------------------------
Add "dependencies/lib"  and friends to search paths of B.xcodeproj ? (y/N)
```

where you should say YES. Now it will build.

## Inheriting our work in C

So go to folder C, and do the usual setup as

```console
mulle-bootstrap init
echo "B" > .bootstrap/repositories
mkdir -p .bootstrap/settings/B
echo "/usr/local/include/B" > .bootstrap/settings/B/xcode_public_headers
mulle-bootstrap
```

This will now use the dependency information from B, to automatically also
build A and get the header of A into the right place.



## Using cmake

Then try it again with cmake. Here we set up **mulle-bootstrap** to fetch cmake
if not present and to use cmake as the only build tool:

```console
cd C
mulle-bootstrap clean dist    # throw away results from "Using xcodebuild"
echo "cmake" >> .bootstrap/brews
mkdir -p .bootstrap/settings
echo "cmake" >> .bootstrap/settings/build_preferences
mulle-bootstrap
```

> This is actually cheaing a little, because the CMakeLists.txt files already
habe 'include/[A|B]' set. But you could set dispense_public_headers like you
can set xcode_public_headers.
